## Abstract

The MicroBooNE experiment is a liquid argon TPC experiment designed for short-baseline neutrino physics, currently running at Fermilab. Due to its location near the surface, cosmic muons can be a source of backgrounds to several analyses and a good understanding of them is of fundamental importance for the experiment. This study presents a method of using an external muon counter system to determine the cosmic-ray reconstruction efficiency in MicroBooNE.

Data has been acquired with the external muon counter system placed in the three different positions, corresponding to cosmic rays hitting different parts of the LArTPC.

The reconstruction of the tracks is performed using the multi-algorithm Pandora framework. The data reconstruction efficiency is e<sub>data</sub> = 96.1 +- 0.1 (stat) +- 1.1 (sys) %, in good agreement with the Monte Carlo reconstruction efficiency e<sub>MC</sub> = 96.3 +- 0.1 %.

This analysis represents a small-scale demonstration of the method that can be used with the data coming from the recently installed Cosmic Ray Tagger, which is able to tag ~80% of the cosmic rays passing through the MicroBooNE detector.
